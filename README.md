MMIP: Microbiome Metabolome Integration Platform


## Web service  

Web service for MMIP is present at: https://bioinfo.jisiasr.org/mmip/

<b>MMIP Manual:</b> Details on how to get started can be found in manual: https://bioinfo.jisiasr.org/mmip/manual.php


## The MMIP workflow:
This server is designed for prediction of the metabolites that could be produced by the microbial community during different health condition by using their metagenomics data (16S-rRNA). Furthermore, it also helps you to compare your real-time metabolomic (untargeted) data with predicted metabolite and helps to see what could be the most probable source of the metabolites.
